This repository contains MATLAB code for constructing an MSC (Minimum Spanning Cluster) tree network based on cancer gene expression data.

The analysis workflow includes the following steps:

1. Download the MATLAB scripts provided in this folder.

2. Obtain the expression data from the Synapse project page: https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68458567/files/. Place all data files and MATLAB scripts in the same working directory on your local machine.

3. Run the main script by executing "Run_cancer_network.m" in MATLAB.

4. Visualize the resulting MSC tree network by opening the output file "MSCtree_out.xml" using Cytoscape.
