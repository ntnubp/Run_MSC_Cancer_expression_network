# MSC Tree Network Construction from Cancer Expression Data

This repository contains MATLAB code for constructing a **Minimum Span Clustering (MSC)** tree network based on cancer gene expression data available from the [Synapse project page](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68458567/files/).**

## Overview
The analysis workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Download this repository**, which contains the required MATLAB scripts and functions.

2. **Download the expression data and sample metadata** from the from the [Synapse project page](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68458567/files/).

3. Place all data files and MATLAB code **in the same working folder** on your local machine.

4. Run the main script by executing *Run_cancer_network.m* in MATLAB. 

5. Visualize the resulting MSC tree network by opening the output file *MSCtree_out.xml* using [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).
