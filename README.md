# MSC Tree Network Construction from Cancer Expression Data

 **This repository contains MATLAB code for constructing an MSC (Minimum Span Clustering) tree network based on cancer gene expression data.**

## Overview
The analysis workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Download** this repository (MATLAB scripts and functions)..

2. **Obtain the expression data and sample information** from the [Synapse project page](https://www.synapse.org/Synapse:syn68458567/files/).

3. Place all data files and MATLAB code **in the same working folder** on your local machine.

4. Run the main script by executing *Run_cancer_network.m* in MATLAB.

5. Visualize the resulting MSC tree network by opening the output file *MSCtree_out.xml* using Cytoscape.
